# LoginLogOutModule
(Small but interesting code in Java and MySql with database connectivity using JDBC.)

3rd year Engineering students may find this project useful for their academic work.

Its a small Java code for login and logout functionality.
I did this using JSP , Servlet, JDBC and MySql.
This code takes care of Back and Refresh vulnerability and deep URL without login vulnerability.
I did this small project by referring one of the tutorial by Navin Reddy on youtube.
